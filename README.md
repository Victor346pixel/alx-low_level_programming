*C - LANGUAGE OVERVIEW*  
C is a general-purpose, high-level language that originated from the work of Dennis M. Ritchie, who initially developed it for creating the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. The first implementation of C took place on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie presented the inaugural accessible description of C, now recognized as the K&R standard.

The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and nearly all UNIX application programs have been authored using the C language.

C has evolved into a extensively employed professional language for a variety of reasons:

- _Ease of acquisition_
- _Structured nature_
- _Production of efficient programs_
- _Capability to manage low-level tasks_
- _Compatibility with diverse computing platforms_

*NOTABLE ASPECTS OF C:*

- C was conceived to script an operating system known as UNIX.
- C is a successor to the B language, which emerged around 1970.
- The language received formal standardization in 1988 through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
- By 1973, the entire UNIX operating system had been composed in the C language.
- Presently, C stands as the most prevalent and favored language for system programming.
- Numerous cutting-edge software applications have been realized through C.
- Contemporary prominent entities such as the Linux operating system and the relational database management system MySQL owe their existence to C's implementation.
