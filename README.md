C - LANGUAGE OVERVIEW C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M.

Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.

The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs have been written in C.

C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.

Easy to learn

1. Structured language

2. It produces efficient programs.

3. It can handle low-level activities.

4. It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
